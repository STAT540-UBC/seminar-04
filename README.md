# Feedback and Proposed Changes
* Had trouble installing multiple bioconductor packages with one command on my windows 10 machine, split this into 2 lines
* added a brief blurb about using the data.table package for working with larger tabular datasets
* `left_join` is used twice, once outside of a function (on its own) and it's not explained, added joins and a link to their behavior in where other dpylr verbs are explained
* added seed to random probe plotting so it's reproducible
* part 3 exercise wasn't clear on what deliverable was expected, I changed it to say to plot this new column
* `getBM` function may return errors if the R / Bioconductors versions are not the most up-to-date. To avoid this kind of errors, I added `useCache = FALSE` in the `getBM` function.
